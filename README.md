# mqtt-zig
Zig implementation of MQTT v3.1/v3.1.1/v5.0 codec. The code is ported from my rust library: [mqtt-proto](https://github.com/akasamq/mqtt-proto). This library is intended for both **client** and **server** usage (with `strict` protocol validation).

## Current State:
* Implemented versions
  - v3.1
  - v3.1.1
* Test Coverage: `92.2%` (by kcov)
